Tables, Arrays and storing values.
=======================

Within squirrel there are many ways to store information, but when storing an unspecified ammount of information, or storing information on a player-by-player basis, you need to use arrays or tables.

Arrays
------

Arrays can store large sets of data and are indexed using numbers, starting from 0, and are declared using `array<type> arrayname` the <type> identifier can be ignored but will result in the array being of the type `var`.
  
```cpp
array<int> numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

print(numbers[0])
>>1
print(numbers[5])
>>6
```

adding and removing values from arrays can be done using `.append(value)` and `.remove(index)`. 

additionally the index of values can be found using the `.find` function and the length by using the `.len()` function

```cpp
array<int> numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

print(numbers.find(3))
>>2
print(numbers[5])
>>6
numbers.remove(5)
print(numbers[5])
>>7
print(numbers.len())
>>9
array<int> empty = []
empty.append(5)
print(empty[0])
>>5
```

Tables
---------
Tables are similar to arrays but with one primary difference, rather than use a numerical index system tables allow you do define your own indexes, similar to pythons `dict` type.
  
Creation of a table is done in a similar way to arrays, however may have 2 types declared for the type of the index and the type of the content, much like arrays this will default to `var` if ignored
```cpp
table<string, int> numberofletters = {"hello": 5}
```
unlike arrays however adding values to tables cannot be done using `.append` or similar means, as the index must also be declared, adding to tables is done using the `<-` operator like so.

```cpp
table<entity, int> playerkills = {}
foreach(entity player in GetPlayerArray())
  playerkills[player] <- 5
```

2D arrays and Tables of Arrays
---------------
Another attribute of tables and arrays is that they can store any value type, including tables and arrays themselves. this can be used to store an array within a table, useful if you want to store multiple values related to each index in a single variable
                            
to create a 2d array you simply define the data type as beign an array of arrays like so.
```cpp
array<array<int>> 2darray = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
print(2darray[1][1])
>>5
```
