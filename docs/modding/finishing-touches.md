# Finishing touches

## Best practices

Make sure to name your mod in the form `<your name>.<mod name>`, similar to the existing default mods, like `Northstar.Client`, `Northstar.CusomServer`, ... \
Note that the Northstar name (`Northstar.xyz`) is reserved for mods delievered with the Northstar install and should therefore **NOT** be used.

It is recommended to upload the source code of your mod to a public repository like [Github](https://github.com/) to give your users a place to suggest changes and leave feedback in an organised manner.

## Mod submission

Currently the designated place to share your mods with others are two Discord channels in the in the _Modding_ category on the [Northstar Discord](https://northstar.tf/discord):

- `#northstar-client-mods` for client-side only mods like HUD changes, skins, etc.
- `#northstar-server-mods` for mods that primarily target servers, like new gamemodes, moderation tools, etc.

[Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/) support is planned for the future to offer an easily searchable platform for downloading and submitting mods.
